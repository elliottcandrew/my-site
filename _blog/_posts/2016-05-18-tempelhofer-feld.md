Standing at any point in Tempelhofer Feld you can always see the top half of TV Tower; it can’t really be escaped in Berlin. <!--more--> The needle-like structure is an icon of the city’s corporate interests, from the highest vantage point in the city it looks down at the huge park—the park looks back in defiance.

In 2014 a referendum to block 4700 apartments being built on the site was voted in favour of by 64.3%. In doing so, Berliners excersised a stubborn right to this part of the city, even in the face of strong government and media campaigns for its development. As a result of the referendum a conseravation act was written into law, forbidding development of any sort on the site. Only temporary structures can be erected and even park benches and portable toilets receive close scrutiny. Two years on and the citizens initiative ‘100% Tempelhofer Feld’ are once again campaigning to save the park, this time to force the government to stick to their word.

##### *“We just came here and didn’t have any money and no clue how to organise something like this, but we were very motivated by the idea of having a place where freedom is not just a word but something that is palpable”*

When the weather is good the site plays host to hoardes of cyclists, skaters, tourists and revellers alike. As you would expect, the old airfield is completely flat with most of the 300 hectares covered in open grass. Narrow gravel and tarmac paths criss-cross the expanse, while two parallel runways are the lasting scars of its previous life. The Barbecue area is equally well-used, if not more so, on sunny days smoke rises above the crowds along with the music and conversation from every corner. Offensively loud music pumps from a mobile speaker unit being wheeled around the park by a group of tipsy, sunburnt thirty-something men. Groups of teenagers gather and disipate as quickly as they arrived; there is a changing rythmn of movement, a collective eb-and-flow that is as unpredictable as the future of the park itself.
