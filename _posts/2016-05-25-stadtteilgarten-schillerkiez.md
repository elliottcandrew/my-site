######Although conserved by law after the 2014 referendum victory, the park is still under threat from private development plans and council efforts to overturn the 2014 referendum result. <!--more--> This is the source of renewed legal struggle for the citizen’s initiative ‘100% Tempelhofer Feld’ who are compaigning for another referendum, to force the city council to respect referenda outcomes. Canvassing for local campaigns such as above, regularly take place at the park gates, unlike other parts of the city known for demonstrations – such as Kotbusser Tor for example – the park doesn’t seem to attract much political antagonism. Perhaps a symptom of the sites tenuous legal status and the terms of its permitted existence.

######Berliners use Tempelhof with a great deal of pride. It represents an ability to shape their city above and beyond the usual forces of realty investment. Though construction of any kind Food, drink and segway tours ￼￼￼is necessarily limited, the self-built community gardens draw the passing residency of readers, writers, smokers, drinkers and anyone you can think of. The gardens were built before the referendum and are therefore protected by the conservation act, it is only a shame that these crooked wooden assemblies can’t be extended past their boundaries, into a labyrinth of wacky gardens. There are indeed liminations to the act.

######The park is open to all but is closed at 8pm, at which point rotating stiles allow anyone remaining inside to leave at their leisure. If you spend any amount of time here, you can’t help but notice the diversity of TF’s visitors, nor the apparent sense of freedom and mutual tolerance. Through the ‘100% THF’ initiative, the site is linked with other community spaces in Berlin.
