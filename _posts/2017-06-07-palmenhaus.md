Palmenhaus is a temporary structure designed to serve as an information and education hub for refugees living in the Flughafen Tempelhof refugee camp. The site is integrated with the [InfoCompass](http://place-making.org/projects/info-compass-berlin) platform to connect users with local social initiatives, providing vital information and guidance to people looking to establish their life in Berlin.  
&nbsp;  
Palmenhaus was conceptualized and designed as a collaborative venture between [place/making](http://place-making.org/) and [Atelier Fanelsa](http://www.atelier-fanelsa.de/).
