#####The site of the Airlift that served as West-Berlin’s lifeline during the Cold War is now the largest covered refugee shelter in Europe. <!--more-->

######Flughafen Tempelhof has had an eventful history. Air-traffic operation began in 1923 and prior to it’s closure by referendum in 2008, it was arguably the longest functioning airport in the world.6 Construction of the building as we know it today began in 1934, instigated by the National Socialist Party as part of the “meglomaniac project of World Capital Germania”.

######As the sun sets over Tempelhofer Feld, the monolithic canopy of the airport forms an artificial horizon that frames the pink and purple hues of the sky. It is a disarming sight for such an imposing structure.

######The building itself forms a huge arc around the west perimeter of the airfield, stretching 1.2km with U-bahn stops at either end. The interior is equally vast, with 300,000sqm of largely uninterupted space it is clear why the city government decided to reuse it as a refugee shelter. The main tenants however are the Berlin Polizei, they have rented parts of the building since 1951 and now occupy approximately 46,000sqm.

######Four of the airport’s seven hangar’s now accomodate displaced peoples of conflict in the middle-east. Just six months after opening of the camp, it is soon to be the largest of its kind in Europe. According to media sources there are currently some 3000 residents of the NUK (‘notunterkunft’ German for ‘shelter’), while official statistics from TAMAJA give a more modest estimation based on weekly counts, of 1344 occupants.

######Although the camp is set to stay for 3 years at least, it is unclear what the future holds, indeed much of the response to this crisis is uncertain. Berlin, along with the whole of Europe was unprepared for the scale of the problem. An estimated 80,000 refugees are expected to arrive in Berlin over the course of 2016 and with no forseable end to current conflict the displacement may go on for years to come. The real challenge then, is not just to find suitable housing for all of these people, but also to begin the extended process of integrating them with wider society.
