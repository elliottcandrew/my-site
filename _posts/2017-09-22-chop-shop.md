I worked with [Chop Shop](http://chopshopcnc.com/) to design this small internal canopy that creates a cosy and informal space within the office. The structure was designed as 4 separate sections that could be constructed in the workshop, easily transported to the site and finally assembled in-situ with minimal effort.
