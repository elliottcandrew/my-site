A conceptual proposal for the HOWOGE Housing Association to re-imagine the old East-Berlin theater as a community hub for film & media, making-spaces, events and offices. With more than 3500m<sup>2</sup> of unoccupied space the theater presents a great opportunity to boost the surrounding district of Lichtenberg with much needed production spaces and facilites, while integrating with the existing music school and [Kulturhaus Karlshorst](http://www.kulturhaus-karlshorst.info/).
<br><br>
The program is broken down into categories defined by use and spatial typologies; offices and ateliers in small rooms, co-working, media production and workshops occupy the larger ground-floor spaces while the main hall and outdoor piazza host temporary events and performances.
<br><br>
This proposal was developed in collaboration with [Urban Drift](http://www.urbandrift.org/)
